I am taking this course because it is a requirement for the software development certification program. In the constantly improving world of technology, being able to understand the basics of programming and computer logic is essential. This course will be able to help me understand the basic skills needed to understand the programming fundamentals. By completing this course, I will not only meet one of the requirements for my certification but also gain the knowledge needed to be able to succeed in the field.
